# PairShare

An app to keep track of (shared) expenses between two people. 
Using the code from the repo you can setup your own google firestore backend for the app and therefore manage your data on your own.

## Android:
The android folder contains the source code for the android pairshare app.

## functions
The functions folder contains firebase functions for serverless serverside (yeah, i know how that sounds :D) cloud functions to support the app.
Currently no functions are used.

Planned: Firebase Notifications to inform others when an Expense was added.

In Progress...
